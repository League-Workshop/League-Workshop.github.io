        <h3>Scary Maze(Eclipse)</h3>
         
<p class="normal">
    The recipe advises students to use <a href="http://pixlr.com/editor/">Pixlr</a> to make a maze, but any simple image editor will work. If time is short, a pre-drawn maze is provided in the package, or students can find a suitable image on the Internet to drag and drop into the project. 
        </p>   

 <p class="normal">   
     Note: Explain to the students that the recipe uses color to determine which is the maze path and which is "out of bounds". If they want to use their own image, they need one that has distinct color zones.
        </p>
        
        
               <h3>Alternative</h3>
        <p class="normal">   
     If preferred, students can use this section to complete games they started in Section 4, or code games from Section 4 that they did not get a chance to try out.
